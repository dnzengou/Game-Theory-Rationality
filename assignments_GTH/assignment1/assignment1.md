### Formulate a game situation of a (preferably) interesting interaction situation.

The game I am presenting here is called} <i>Kissoro</i> or Igisoro, its variant being called Awale, also known as Awele, Kisoro, Wari etc.), among the known strategy games, one of the oldest. There are traces of its roots back to Egyptians of Ancient Egypt, through a game called senet (game of course with several rows) which could look like . The real origin of the game would be around the fifth and sixth century AD. The game has gradually spread in the Middle East as well as throughout the African continent.
Kissoro is a "board game"; it is the equivalent of failures in Africa. In Central African Republic, it is very popular with Southerners population (whose Yakoma tribe my father belongs to). But it is also found everywhere in the entire territory.
The greatest players are usually the elderly, because of their long experience of the game, hence its reputation of "game of old men", but like many games nowadays, it is nowadays played by more and more young people which contributes to its growing notoriety.
It is played with a wooden board dug holes and seeds.

<b>The kisoro has a 4-row, 8-hole board, each player using two rows, and 64 pawns. Regulatory pawns are tamarind seeds ("wassa" in Sango). But metal balls or gravel can also act as pawns.
The rules of Awale are simple and the game is really easy to learn. On the other hand, the strategies to be implemented to overcome are formidable! The rules vary from one region to another, and sometimes even from one village to another.</b>


### Identify the players in the game.

The Kissoro plateau is divided into two parts. Players facing each other, each player plays in his game side.\\ You are player I (1); the opponent is player II (2). You have your territory down, it is the South territory; that of your opponent is above, it is the North territory.\


### Describe the actions and possible strategies.


At the beginning of each game, each player has 32 tokens (pawns or seeds) -- 48 or even more tokens sometimes, thus 4 to 8 per hole on average, depending on the style of Kisoro we are playing --  he or she has at  disposal to create his or her strategy. \ If we do the parallel to the game of military tactics, the two players, like two armies, begin as if they move simultaneously, in absolute equality and in parallel, each on his side. \

#### 1.

Each player plays in turn, whoever plays first is drawn at random. The player will take all the seeds present in one of the holes of his territory and distribute them, one per hole, moving the pawns in the opposite direction of clockwise.\

#### 2.

By depositing the last counter, if the hole is empty, the player places the token in the next hole and his turn stops (he jumps the empty box). If the hole of the last piece is not empty, the player takes the new pile and continues the distribution by following the direction of movement, and so on until the last piece falls into an empty hole. The player can not move zero (0) or a single (1) token. To move the pieces, he must have at least two pieces in a box\

#### 3.

Capture if the last seed sown falls into a hole of the opponent already having seeds, the player captures the resulting seeds. Two conditions must be verified:<br>
1. The last piece in the pile played falls into a box on the line of attack and this box is not empty.
The line of attack is the line that is in contact with the opponent's board.</br>
2. The opponent has one or more pawns in the holes in the column where the last pawn fell.\

#### 4.

Two modes of distribution after capture of the opponent's pions exist;<br>\
- Go back:
The player starts distributing the opponent's pieces starting where he took the pile that allowed him to capture.\
- Plane:</br>
The player starts distributing the opponent's pieces starting where he has put his last counter.<br>\

#### Note.


<i>The game ends when</i> \
- The player has taken all the pieces of the opponent (very rare case)<br>\
- The opponent a pawn in his boxes. He can not play anymore.\

#### Suggest reasonable utility (payoff) functions.

As in warfare, you have to take advantage of the imbalance of the enemy force to capture as many enemy men as possible (which are then incorporated into your own base) but without exposing your own pawns. Therefore what motivates players is to capture, or not have captured, the opponents' tokens. The victory is to the one who captures all the elements of the other at best, a maximum of token at least.\
